It is expected that our global population will grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion by the year 2050. Finding solutions to feed the growing global population has become a pressing issue for organizations, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists in agriculture and food sectors. These solutions range from changing the way we grow and raise our food to changing the way we eat.

To make matters more challenging, Earth's climate is changing and is influenced by agriculture. As the global population has expanded and become wealthier, the demand for food, energy, and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has the demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interconnected: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production requires water resources; agriculture provides a potential source of energy and consumes significant water.

Ensuring that everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges we face.

Your goal is to analyze the environmental impact of the global production and distribution of food and feed. The work should be delivered keeping in mind that the Jupyter notebook should resemble a presentation to be shown to a hypothetical client: avoid creating a project that is too verbose and repetitive in its analyses.

Choosing what to show and why to show that concept over another is one of the skills to develop for this project.

The project needs to be divided into 6 phases:

- Discovery (identification of the problem and objectives)
- Data selection
- Data cleaning
- Data exploration
- Data transformation
- Data visualization.
